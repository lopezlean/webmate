# Webmate

Welcome to the WebMate repository. WebMate is a developer-friendly WYSIWYG editor and web component builder. The idea behind this project is to provide a user-friendly interface for customers without the need for any coding skills. With WebMate, users can easily use the web components that you create, while developers can benefit from the ability to create encapsulated, reusable, and composable components that can be used across multiple projects using the standard Web Components API.

WebMate is based on web components technology, which allows developers to create custom components that can be used in any web application. It is designed to work with all modern browsers and supports a wide range of features, including animations, re-order components, and custom styling.

Using WebMate, developers can create custom components by simply adding the elements from the toolbox onto the canvas. They can then customize these components by adjusting their properties, adding styles, and configuring events.

Overall, WebMate is an excellent tool for both developers and non-technical users who want to use custom web components quickly and easily. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to get in touch with us. We hope you enjoy using WebMate!
